# Kara Howes Forms Project

The assignment was to code and produce a form for an internet site. We had to add the form action to send the content to httpbin.


## The problem
I decided to code for two forms on my pre-existing website. Ths first form is part of the index.html and entitles the reader to a free version of a print I have produced, they just need to sign up with their email address.I found a simple and clean-looking form on the web and used this as a template for my form. I then had some more time so I decided to add a "Contact" page onto my website and there I add a form asking the readers to contact me with any queries, messages etc. I have used some basic HTML form coding, with text, email and textarea inputs. In the end. my website is now 6 pages, which has been quite difficult to focross-reference etc.
If I had more time, I would've checked the HTML formatting.
